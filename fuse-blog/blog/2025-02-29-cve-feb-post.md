# Most Critical JavaScript CVEs from February 2025

February saw a significant surge of **cross-site scripting (XSS)** and **arbitrary JavaScript execution** vulnerabilities impacting widely used libraries and platforms. Below is a concise overview of the most critical threats this month, followed by essential tactics to help you stay protected.



## 1. Key Vulnerability Clusters

### A. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **CVE-2025-27109, CVE-2025-27108, CVE-2025-27088**  
  Affect libraries such as **solid-js**, **dom-expressions**, and **s3-proxy**. Attackers can inject malicious scripts or user input that renders as raw HTML, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further compromises.

  ```javascript
   // Example of using DOMPurify to sanitize user input
   const cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
   document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = cleanHTML;
   ```

- **Adobe Commerce CVEs (e.g., CVE-2025-24438, CVE-2025-24428...)**  
  These involve stored XSS in form fields, allowing low-privileged attackers to embed harmful JavaScript that executes in admin or user sessions.

### B. Arbitrary Code & Sandbox Escapes
- **CVE-2025-0982 (Google Cloud Integration Rhino)**  
  A sandbox escape lets malicious code run outside restricted environments. When executed, it can escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access to other system components.

- **CVE-2025-24010 (Vite)**  
  Due to default CORS settings and lack of Origin header validation, remote attackers could craft requests and potentially read or modify responses, compromising build-time or dev server security.

## 2. Common Mitigation Tactics

1. **Update Dependencies Promptly**  
   - Monitor sources like the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) or GitHub Advisory Database.  
   - Patch or upgrade to the latest secure versions of vulnerable packages.

2. **Implement Strict Input Sanitization**  
   - Use vetted libraries (e.g., DOMPurify) or framework-native sanitizers for HTML.  
   - Escape or strip out script tags and risky attributes (e.g., `onload`, `javascript:`).

   ```javascript
   // Example of using DOMPurify to sanitize user input
   const cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
   document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = cleanHTML;
   ```

3. **Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP)**  
   - Restrict the loading of scripts, images, and other resources to trusted domains.  
   - Disallow inline scripts by default (`script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';` etc.).

4. **Review Application Configuration**  
   - Disable or lock down potentially dangerous features (e.g., dev tools, default CORS settings).  
   - For frameworks like Node.js or Deno, ensure production configurations restrict debug or experimental APIs.

5. **Least Privilege & Access Controls**  
   - Limit who can modify front-end code or create new pages/forms.  
   - Implement role-based access to reduce the impact of an exploit if it occurs.

## Conclusion

Staying ahead of critical JavaScript vulnerabilities requires a multi-pronged strategy. Swiftly applying patches, enforcing strong security headers, and sanitizing user input can dramatically reduce your exposure. By monitoring these threats and hardening your application stack, you'll minimize the likelihood of severe incidents and better protect both your users and your infrastructure.
