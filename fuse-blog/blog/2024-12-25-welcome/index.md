# Welcome to the FuseLock Blog üöÄ

---

We‚Äôre excited to kick off our official fuselock blog. 
Here, we‚Äôll write about vulnerabilities, app security, protection, CVEs and share how fuselock tackles hidden leaks lurking within your packages and architecture. 


## What to Expect from This Blog?

- **Technical Deep Dives on Supply Chain Attacks**  
  Examples of real-world incidents and how they could have been prevented.
- **Tutorials & How-Tos**  
  Step-by-step guides on integrating FuseLock into new or existing Node.js projects.
- **Industry Trends & Stats**  
  Analyzing the latest vulnerability disclosures (200‚Äì300 monthly, 100+ high severity in six months!) and their impact on the JavaScript ecosystem.
- **Comparisons & Best Practices**  
  Reviewing alternative tools like npm audit, Snyk, Dependabot, or sandboxing solutions, and how FuseLock complements or surpasses them.


## What are we trying to solve?

A typical Node.js project may directly pull in dozens of packages, which in turn depend on hundreds‚Äîor even thousands‚Äîof transitive dependencies. That is a LOT. Even if you lock your dependencies and use static vulnerability scanners, **malicious code** can hide in ‚Äúclean‚Äù packages and remain undetected for months until an exploit surfaces. Existing tools primarily focus on **known** vulnerabilities; as a result, **zero-day or undetected malware** stay under the radar.

### Why Focus on Node.js and NPM?

- **2.3+ million NPM packages** exist today, offering rich functionality but also serving as potential entry points for attackers.  
- **200‚Äì300 vulnerabilities** per month are reported in the JavaScript ecosystem, and in the last six months alone, we‚Äôve seen **over 100** high or critical-severity flaws.  
- **175‚Äì200 million downloads** of potentially vulnerable packages occur each month‚Äîa staggering **1.5 billion** a year.  
- **NPM supply chain attacks** are responsible for a substantial portion of CVEs, with threat actors exploiting the open ecosystem to exfiltrate data, execute malicious code, or compromise critical systems.

## We are building fuselock: NoEscape solution

**This easy to get started**

```javascript
   npm install -g fuselock
```

##Why does it matter? 
Well, _Do you really need your pie chart library to open up 100 different ports, communicate with 50 different domains, and have write access to sensitive files/folder?_ fuselock enforces the principle of least privilege‚Äîeach dependency can only do what you explicitly allow.

##How are we aiming to solve this? 
**fuselock** is our security middleware for Node.js designed to **lock down** hidden threats in your dependencies. We focus on **both static and runtime protections**:

1. **Restrictive Permission Management**  
   - We start from a default ‚Äúdeny all‚Äù posture.  
   - Permissions are managed centrally (e.g., via a `package.json` policy section).  

2. **Network Security**  
   - Block unauthorized connections to unapproved hosts.  
   - Prevent rogue server creation or suspicious outbound traffic.

3. **System Security**  
   - Fine-grained file system controls.  
   - Restrict child processes to block malicious code execution.

4. **Runtime Code Execution Controls**  
   - Blocks unauthorized `eval()` or dynamic imports.  
   - Hooks into native Node.js functions to monitor suspicious activity.

5. **Real-Time Logging and Auditing**  
   - Tracks network requests, file operations, and code execution in real time.  
   - Offers an audit trail to highlight potential compromise or unexpected behaviors.
